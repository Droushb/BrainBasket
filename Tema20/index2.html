      Anabet`s Bakery is committed to facilitating the accessibility and usability of its website for all people with disabilities.
      Working with a retained accessibility consultant, we will be implementing over time the relevant portions of the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Level AA
      as our web accessibility standard or other standards to the extent required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (‘ADA”).
      Our website will be tested on a periodic basis with assistive technology such as screen readers and screen magnifiers, and with users with disabilities who use these technologies.
      Please be aware that our efforts are ongoing. If, at any time, you have specific questions or concerns about the accessibility of any particular Web page on our website, please contact us.
      If you do encounter an accessibility issue, we will do our best to assist you.
      We strive for consistency so that each visit to our bakery delivers the same reliably satisfying experience while offering an exciting variety of products.
      Our products change to showcase seasonal ingredients and the exceptions.
      talent of our chefs.<br>
